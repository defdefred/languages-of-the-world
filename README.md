# languages of the world
## written langage
ISO 15924 tells us that there is only 210 codes to covers all writing systems.

So a full byte is enough and allow new one to be added (256-210=46).
## spoken language
ISO 639-3 tells us that there is 8250 codes to covers all referenced languages.

So a full byte is enough for all most used language and another optional byte is more than enough for the others (65536-8250=57286).
